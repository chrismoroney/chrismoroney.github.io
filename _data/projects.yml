- name: Community Small Groups
  descr: "Outreach and fellowship are very important principles in the Christian community. Thus, many churches and communities create small groups in order to share and study the gospel as well as to provide brother/sisterhood in the church community. Part of this fellowship involves meeting many different people. However, it can be difficult for people to meet new people in a community, and it also can be difficult for church leaders to assign groups on a weekly basis while encouraging outreach and meeting new people. This is exactly what out project aims to solve. Using a directed graph, we can define a relationship between a set of people as a person visiting another's house. The nodes of this graph would be the people, and the directed edges indicate who has visited whose house. In order to establish a set of hosts, we switch up the hosts each week in order for every person to be able to eventually visit everyone's houses. We also use various queues to assign people to fill into various houses if they already have visited all of the hosts, or if all of the groups are filled up and there are leftover people."

- name: Shopping Bot
  descr: "Google’s Do-it-yourself artificial intelligence kits, also known as AIY allow you to create and program devices using concepts from AI such as Computer Vision, Speech Detection or Natural Language Processing. Here I demonstrate my project, built on AIY, that provides a shopping bot. I tell it what I want to buy, and it will find matching products on eBay, emailing me the results, so I can see if there’s anything I like!"

- name: Mameon
  descr: "Mameon is a startup business from the Stanford Startup Garage class and Startup Venture Studio that I had the opportunity to work on. Mameon's purpose is to sell inexpensive advertisements to other startup businesses so that these startup businesses have an opportunity to share their stories. Rather than having to spend thousands of dollars on an advertisement, Mameon allows its customers to create customizable advertisements through its unique scripting process. This allows small businesses to create an advertisement that tells their own story, rather than having another company create the story for them."
